The auto-correlations of the changes/returns of an asset is very weak, thus prediction of the returns is not possible. However, auto-correlation of volatility is strong, and the volatility can be predicted. (GARCH model)

My next day's volatility is correlated with today's volatility. 
```{r}
library(tseries)     # provide get.hist.quote()
library(timeSeries)  # to provide as.timeSeries()


P = get.hist.quote(instrument = "^DJI", start="2008-01-01", end="2013-01-1",
               quote = c("AdjClose"),provider = "yahoo", compression = "d")

plot(P)

r = diff(data.matrix(log(P)))

acf(r)
acf(r*r)
```
